# AI Pathfinder Visualizer

A modular Python application designed to visualize classic AI search algorithms on a 2D grid using a **Catppuccin Mocha** color palette. This project focuses on high-level abstraction and strict separation of concerns between UI, Logic, and Algorithms.

## 🛠️ Features
* **6 Search Algorithms**: Includes BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDDFS, and Bidirectional Search.
* **Real-time Visualization**: Generators are used to visualize the frontier expansion and path discovery step-by-step.
* **Interactive UI**: A custom-built control panel and grid interaction system using Pygame.
* **Clean Architecture**: Deeply abstracted layers for easier maintenance and testing.
